# hello-world
wow! a Repository!
no seriously it's just a random repository, don't freak out ok.

Well anyway, not much about me to talk about.... hmmm.
The tech world is pretty nice, sad to see that alt software is getting beaten like it is - makes me pretty angry you know?
I love programming but am terrible at it, so I need to study and practice and get better and learn and get a beter job, so i can make lotts of mula!
